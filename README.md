# An Analysis of Racial Discrimination in San Diego Police Stops

### Introduction
This repository includes both Python code and a LaTeX report as part of an interdisciplinary study (Data Science and the Social Sciences) treating police stops in San Diego as an algorithmic decision making system, evaluating whether or not it judges individuals of varying races fairly based on theoretical frameworks by political philosopher John Rawls.

### Files
`EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing an exploratory data analysis to determine whether or not an extensive investigation into the data is appropriate

`data.zip`: source data containing several years of police stop data including a variety of features from date and time to subject and officer attributes

`notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing a combination of both written and statistical analyses on the data

`paper.pdf`: LaTeX report compiled from `notebook.ipynb` as a final, more accessible version of the analysis

### Requirements
The following Python packages are required to run the Jupyter notebooks:

- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
